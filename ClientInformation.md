# Introduction #

The following provides a simple description of our client for the development of the SAL Graphical User Interface.  Our client is our main source of information for not only requested features of the system, but also for the SAL API.


# Client Details #

  * **Name:**  Gilles Gigan
  * **Organisation:**  James Cook University
  * **Title:**  JCU Senior Research Officer - eResearch
  * **Project:** Development/Improvement of SAL

# Overview #

Gilles has been the sole developer and researcher for the SAL API.  SAL is a powerful interfacing tool intended for large networks of sensor devices.  The main purpose of SAL is to allow multiple, unique devices to collect and report many different types of data to one uniform system.

The current simulation of SAL is a simple terminal program that provides access to textual data from the sensors and basic command-line control of sensor capabilities.

The SAL-I team has been asked to provide the client a usable graphical user interface that utilizes the SAL API to fetch and display data to the user in an intelligible form.  This is especially important for visual and audio data from devices such as web cameras, and microphones.

As the developer of the SAL API, Gilles Gigan will be able to provide the SAL-I team with essential information for utilizing and understanding the capabilities of SAL.  He will also be providing us with a large number of supported sensor devices which will be used to test the SAL API within the proposed web GUI.  If any questions should arise pertaining to SAL or discrepancies in the workings of SAL-I, Gilles should be available in his office during regular work-week hours.  Outside of work hours, he can be contacted via his JCU email.
