#summary An assessment of the potential risks involved in the development of SAL-I.
#labels Risk-Analysis,Risks

= Overview =

The following is meant to identify risks that could potentially enter the SAL Interface project and hinder development progress to a degree.  The list includes a description of the risk involved, the likelihood of the risk's occurrence (scaled 1-10), the perceived impact of the risk on project variables (scaled 1-10), and the overall importance of the risk (_Likelihood x Impact_).


= Risk Table =

|| *Description* || *Likelihood* || *Impact* || *Importance* || *Countermeasures* ||
|| Choosing the wrong Web API could result in debugging difficulties || 6 || 9 || 54 || List, research, and compare candidate APIs ||
|| Insufficient cooperation and communication with teammates || 5 || 10 || 50 || Establish good communication between project members; Use supervisor as to coordinate internal team issues ||
|| Unreliable estimates could cause sunk cost || 5 || 9 || 45 || Estimating and find the unreliable points earlier ||
|| Malicious Users of SAL-I exploit the system (Uncertainty of security issues) || 7 || 6 || 42 || Address the possibility of security issues with client ||
|| Communicating insufficiently with the client will cause misunderstandings in the requirements of the project || 4 || 10 || 40 || Communicating with client and supervisor frequently -- Establish effective communication mediums ||
|| Client requests added features || 8 || 5 || 40 || Establish base requirements early so adding to the system is relatively easy ||
|| A Poor Development Strategy may result in poor quality deliverables || 4 || 8 || 32 || Seek help from supervisor for an experienced opinion on choosing the right development strategy ||
|| Cannot finish the project within time limitation (November 30th) || 3 || 10 || 30 || Consider using Xu as an extended maintenance representative of the SAL-I project after the other team members have left ||
|| The system may lose flexibility as more device compatibility is added to it || 5 || 6 || 30 || Design the code with the support the flexibility in mind ||
|| The establishment of the LINUX workspace and development environment takes longer than expected || 3 || 8 || 24 || Ensure we have the necessary resources for creating the correct development environment with no troubles ||
|| Weak web-development skills could lead to slow coding progress || 4 || 6 || 24 || Develop prototypes to get the team used to web-development ||
|| Scott is planned to be absent for one week sometime in October: Absence of Scott could cause problems with coding progress || 6 || 4 || 24 || Good coordination of workloads before Scott leaves ||
|| Google Project becomes inaccessible -- project development is halted || 1 || 10 || 10 || Create backups of code on JCU servers ||
|| Our client may lose interest in SAL-I || 1 || 10 || 10 || Provide impactive deliverables to keep the client's interest ||
|| Inexperienced and unskilled project team || 10 || 1 || 10 || Establish coding practices and create web-development training ||
|| An alternative to SAL-I is provided by another entity || 1 || 5 || 5 || Provide timely quality deliverables ||
