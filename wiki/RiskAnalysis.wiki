#summary An assessment of the potential risks involved in the development of SAL-I.
#labels Risk-Analysis,Risks

= Overview =

The following is meant to identify risks that could potentially enter the SAL Interface project and hinder development progress to a degree.  The list includes a description of the risk involved, the likelihood of the risk's occurrence (scaled 1-10), the perceived impact of the risk on project variables (scaled 1-10), and the overall importance of the risk (_Likelihood x Impact_).
