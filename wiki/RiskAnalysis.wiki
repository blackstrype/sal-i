#summary An assessment of the potential risks involved in the development of SAL-I.
#labels Risk-Analysis,Risks

= Overview =

The following is meant to identify risks that could potentially enter the SAL Interface project and hinder development progress to a degree.  The list includes a description of the risk involved, the likelihood of the risk's occurrence (scaled 1-10), the perceived impact of the risk on project variables (scaled 1-10), and the overall importance of the risk (_Likelihood x Impact_).


= Risk Table =

|| *Description* || *Likelihood* || *Impact* || *Importance* || *Countermeasures* ||
|| Choosing the wrong Web API could result in debugging difficulties || 6 || 9 || 53 || List, research, and compare candidate APIs ||
|| A Poor Development Strategy may result in poor quality deliverables || 4 || 8 || 32 || Seek help from supervisor for an experienced opinion on choosing the right development strategy ||
|| The establishment of the LINUX workspace and development environment takes longer than expected || 3 || 8 || 24 || Ensure we have the necessary resources for creating the correct development environment with no troubles ||
|| Google Project becomes inaccessible -- project development is halted || 1 || 10 || 10 || Create backups of code on JCU servers ||
|| Communicating insufficiently with Client and supervisor will couse missunderstanding to the requiremwnt of the project || 4 || 10 || 40 || Communicating with client and supervisor frecuently ||
|| Inexperienced and unskilled staff || x || x || x || Learing more and follow the command ||
|| Unreliable estimates could couse sunk cost || x || x || x || Doing it and find it earlier ||
|| The system may lose flexibility as more device compatibility is added to it || 5 || 6 || 30 || Improveing the code to support the flexibility ||
|| Client requests added features || 8 || 5 || 40 || Establish base requirements early so adding to the system is relatively easy ||
|| Weak web-development skills could lead to slow coding progress ||
|| Insuffient cooperation with team mates ||
|| absence of Scott could mean less progress on code  || 6 || 3 || 18 || Good coordination of workloads before Scott leave ||
|| Our client may lose interest in SAL-I || 1 || 10 || 10 || Providing impactive deliverables to keep the client's interest ||
|| An alternative to SAL-I is provided by another entity || 1 || 5 || 5 ||
|| Cannot finish our project within time limitation || 3 || 10 || 30 || Design well before act ||
|| Malicious Users of SAL-I exploit the system ||
